# Graduate-Admission-Prediction
This project predicts the probability of a student's admission to a graduate program based on their academic profile using machine learning techniques. The dataset used contains various features such as GRE score, TOEFL score, CGPA, and more. The model is built using **Python**, **Scikit-learn**, and **Machine Learning Algorithms**.


## Dataset
- The dataset consists of student admission records with multiple features:
  - GRE Score
  - TOEFL Score
  - University Rating
  - Statement of Purpose (SOP)
  - Letter of Recommendation (LOR)
  - CGPA
  - Research Experience
  - Chance of Admit (Target Variable)

## Features
- Data preprocessing and feature selection
- Model training using various regression algorithms
- Performance evaluation using metrics like RMSE and RÂ² score
- Data visualization for insights
